/*in my example, this could be used to greet users on a forum or website depending on their frequency to the site
they could get something as simple as a "Welcome back!" if it recognized their IP adress or user information, 
or it could be used to say "You've been visiting us quite a bit lately!" if it sees their IP address or user
